            <h2>Essential Furniture Cleaning Tips</h2>
            <p>Keeping your furniture clean is essential to maintaining its beauty and prolonging its life. For fabric furniture, consider using a vacuum cleaner and spot-cleaning as needed. Wooden furniture can be dusted regularly and treated with furniture polish for a natural shine.</p>
            <p>If you have leather furniture, cleaning it with a soft cloth and mild soap solution works wonders. Avoid direct sunlight to prevent fading, and ensure proper ventilation for longevity.</p>
