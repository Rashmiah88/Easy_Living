            <h2>Maximizing Space with Smart Furniture Choices</h2>
            <p>Living in a small apartment doesnâ€™t mean you need to compromise on furniture style or comfort. Consider opting for multi-functional furniture pieces like a sofa bed or a dining table with storage options. These types of furniture can help maximize the use of your space.</p>
            <p>Vertical storage is another clever solution, using tall shelving units or wall-mounted hooks to free up floor space. The goal is to keep things practical yet stylish.</p>
